# About Me

Hi! I'm Frank Roetker, a student at 
[Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](http://www.rose-hulman.edu/)
double majoring in Software Engineering and Computer Science, as well 
as minoring in Psychology.

I devote a great deal of my free time to personal and group programming 
projects. I have a part-time job as a sub-contracted programmer in which 
I write software for medium to large companies and medical institutions. 
Outside of school and work, I write mobile apps for the Windows Phone and 
Android platforms. I collaborate with others, designing websites and 
exploring new programming languages and technologies.


## Microsoft

I'm going to be working for [Microsoft](http://microsoft.com/) as an 
intern throughout the 2013 summer. I will be working on the 
[Windows Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com/) team as a Software Developer
Engineer in Test (SDET) in Redmond, WA.

## Rose-Hulman Ventures

I've contributed to two separate projects whilst working at RH Ventures:
EdgileGRC and ClotFinder.

### EdgileGRC

For one project I helped develop a new Silverlight application to manage 
enterprise Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance issues for medium 
to large corporations. 

I worked with an external client, [Edgile Inc.](http://www.edgile.com/), 
to develop requirements, added and validated new functionality, and 
troubleshoot issues.

I supported the successful release of this application at two beta sites,
working on a team of three.

Our team used C#, Linq, XAML, and SQL to develop the application.

### ClotFinder

After working on EdgileGRC, I continued to the ClotFinder project. This
project lated two months. During this time I learned and followed 
[Health Level Seven (HL7)](http://www.hl7.org/) standards for storing 
and exchanging electronic health information.

## QuarkNet

In July 2009, I was introduced to 
[Matthew Jones](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/people/faculty/mjones.shtml), 
Associate Professor of Physics at Purdue University. He voiced his concern 
about the future of software for a cosmic ray muon detector (CRMD). This 
device was neglect of an interface robust enough for the tasks for which it 
was built. Professor Jones asked for my assistance in rewriting the software 
so that it could be easily used for a wide range of experiments and by 
anyone ranging from high school students to professionals.

Throughout the development of this software, I faced the problem that 
the CRMD had poor documentation. I was challenged with learning topics 
in particle physics, mastering the execution of experiments with the 
device, and a deep understanding of the data that was collected. I 
gained guidance from Professor Jones regarding the physics discipline 
and feedback on the user interface from teachers in the QuarkNet Teacher 
Institute. 

Twenty months later, I accomplished the goal Professor Jones presented. 
Working independently, with the occasional help of others, I had produced 
an application which is currently in use by Purdueâ€™s QuarkNet Center.

[Here](http://www.physics.purdue.edu/outreach/quarknet/teacher_institute/2012/Software_2012.pdf)
is a presentation given by Professor Jones for this device.
