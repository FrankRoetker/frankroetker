#posts:

* if there are more than one to show, then don't show the post image

* if we're on the search page, then show the images to the left and the gist to the right

* if we're on a page without an image, then use the color layout


- try to find a way to get the scrolling to work on the article for as long as there is text, keeping the left side static. When the next article comes along, show the new image.


- think about how to make the pages extendable - I want to make it so that all pages show up in the search, but if you go to an article that is special, it is recognized as being special. Pictures are all supplementary and can be replaced with flat colors.


- I should probably look into angular directives so I can make pages modular.


- I should also look into mobile testing.
